# "Distance Measurement".

### Description:

#### Implement the system to measure the distance using the ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04


##### 1- ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 1Mhz.

##### 2- Measure the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.

##### 3- The LCD should display the distance value.

##### 4- The project is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture model as follows:

###### HAL: temperature sensor, Dc Motor (Fan), LCD
###### MCAL: ADC, PWM (at Timer0), DIO
